	<h1>Here's some styled content for your viewing pleasure.</h1>
	<h2>First, let's talk typeface.</h2>
	<section class="intro">
		The font family you're looking at is called <strong>Open Sans.</strong><br>
		The sample sentences will be set in <strong>18-point font.</strong><br>
		Supplementary text will be set in <strong>11-point font.</strong><br>
		Cool? Cool. Let's get started.

<div class="label">Let's try changing our font weight.</div>
	<section id="font-weight">Here we have some heavyweight type. You can read it if you want. </section><br>
<div class="label">We can also play around with font style.</div>
	<section id="font-style">For instance, this font is italicized.</section><br>
<div class="label">Next, let's look at wider letter spacing.</div>
	<section id="letter-spacing">Ooooh, look at all this white space!</section><br>
<div class="label"> Dare me to use text-transform to make a sentence uppercase.</div>
	<section id="text-transform"> You didn't have to ask me twice! </section><br>
<div class="label"> And for my final trick, I shall conjure an underline.</div>
	<section id="text-decoration">Viola! Here it is, right here. No, over here. You're looking at it.</section><br>
