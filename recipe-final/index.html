			<h1>Instructions:</h1>

				<ol>
					<li>Prep your chicken. Add the honey, soy sauce, water, lemon juice, and garlic to a small bowl and whisk together.</li>

					<li>If making rice for this recipe, it's good to get it started about now. I would use 2 cups uncooked rice for 4 people, or perhaps a bit less if they prefer smaller portions.</li>

					<li>Press the "sauté" button on your Instant Pot. Add the olive oil and chicken and cook for 3 minutes, stirring often.</li>

					<li>Pour the honey garlic mixture into your Instant Pot and give it a good stir. Close the lid, set it to "sealing" and cook the chicken on high pressure for 5 minutes. It'll take a few minutes to get up to pressure.</li>

					<li>Once the countdown has finished, carefully do a quick release of the pressure.</li>

					<li>Set your Instant Pot to "sauté" again to thicken the sauce. Mix the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl, then add it to your Instant Pot. Cook for a few minutes until the sauce is thickened.</li>
					<li>Season with salt & pepper as needed. Serve over rice. Enjoy!</li>
