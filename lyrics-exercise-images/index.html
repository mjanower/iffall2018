<p class="hook"><i>[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]</i><br>
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us<br>
You're no warrior, ya not so devious</p>

<p class="verse"><i>[U-God:]</i><br>
Yo yo<br>
I was born with this magnet, warned by the dragnet<br>
About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow<br>
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo<br>
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs<br>
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino<br>
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo<br>
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto<br>
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle<br>
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people<br>
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes<br>
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab<br>
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs<br>
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho<br>
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals<br>
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo<br>
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo<br>
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low<br>
Lower than low, lower than zero<br>
Who's your rhymin heroes?<br>
<i> *heavy breathing*</i><br>
("Killa beeeeeeeeeeees?")</p>

<p class="hook"><i>[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]</i><br>
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us<br>
You're no warrior, ya not so devious</p>

<p class="verse"><i>[Bobby Digital:]</i><br>
Bzzzz.. you hear the hornet, you ducks don't want it<br>
I dogs blast turbo, supersonic<br>
Hats off, welcome back, whipe the sweat off<br>
Bobby Digital, half-man and half-cyborg<br>
NY City, home of the fly bitties<br>
With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties<br>
Shorties swallow up the apple cider<br>
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder<br>
With the black interior, my mack superior<br>
to your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria<br>
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables<br>
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables<br>
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+<br>
Watch my bullets scream ("Pheeewwwwww!") and hit the target<br>
You can't trace the path of air for Richard Starlett</p>

<p class="hook"><i>[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]</i><br>
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us<br>
You're no warrior, ya not so devious<br>
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us<br>
You're no warrior, ya not so devious</p>

<p class="verse"><i>[Inspectah Deck:]</i><br>
It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn<br>
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Sourceman<br>
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz<br>
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens<br>
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens<br>
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend<br>
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom<br>
certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom<br>
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom<br>
Kings of our kindom, reppin from our hoodlums<br>
Gotta whip them problems, cuz yo we step on toes<br>
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros<br>
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?<br>
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz<br>
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic<br>
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?<br>
Manifesto, light it like a techno club<br>
Outside I don't expect no love<br>
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it<br>
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid</p>

<p class="hook"><i>[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]</i><br>
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us<br>
You're no warrior, ya not so devious<br>
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us<br>
You're no warrior, ya not so devious</p>
